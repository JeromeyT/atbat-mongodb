atbat-mongodb
=============

A Perl project that pulls data from MLB's AtBat servers and shoves them into a local MongoDB

When this project gets to a point where it is usable I'll writeup a good Readme page. If you are reading this message feel free to drop me a note but don't bother trying ot use the code here.
